# python_tools
Several small and useful Python scripts I've developed for everyday work in Linux

## python3:
- top.py: monitors a set of processes during a period of time and then plots their memory and cpu usage during that time.
  
## python2.7:
- freeze.py: pip freeze without pip. I had the need to list all python modules in a large number of machines where pip wasn't installed and couldn't be installed, so this was my solution.
